Hi! Welcome to my personal blog. It's not meant to be too professional, nor to be taken too seriously. To get a feel for my pursuits and values, you may wish to take a few minutes to read the blog entries listed below. They are the most recent ones and are most representative of my current views and attitudes towards the issues that are covered. The entries are also categorised as either [book reviews]({{ '/books' | relative_url }}), [opinions]({{ '/opinions' | relative_url }}) or a [surprise](https://bit.ly/3ADkCXI).

You might also be less motivated and just want a short summary of my interests. In that case, try [here]({{ '/about' | relative_url }})!
