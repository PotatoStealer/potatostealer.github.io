Hi! I'm Man Keat, an aspiring Computer Science student with a buffet spread of pursuits. My passions are in using Tech for Good and I currently sharpen my toolbox by building websites, trawling through academic papers of machine learning models and by being involved in team-oriented environments. My other interests include number theory, education, historical linguistics and I also have a romantic fascination in astronomy and cosmology. All these are the intellectual pursuits of *this* student that is single-handedly held together by my avid love for coffee and tea.
 
Now, give the pot a good stir and you get a restless ~~nerd~~ student eager to talk your ears off for 2 hours about anything under the sun (while sipping on some coffee of course!). This mini-site is meant to safe-keep my ramblings, thoughts and occasional reviews on recent happenings, but also to provide a glimpse of my interests.

I can be contacted through my email <uselesstaco14@gmail.com>, or connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hu-man-keat-6689a81b3) if that's your cup of coffee (or tea)!
